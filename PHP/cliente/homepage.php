                        <p>Pop art has had an indelible influence on the visual landscape of art and design in the 20th and 21st
                      centuries. This movement, which emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, was heavily inspired by graphic design
                      elements and techniques, and is still a major influence in the world of art and design today. From its
                      roots in advertising and the commercialization of everyday objects to its bold, vibrant, and often
                      humorous visuals, pop art has been an integral part of graphic design for decades.</p>
                        <p>Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, and James Rosenquist are just a few of the many American pop artists who
                      worked in the commercial art industry prior to becoming famous. As a result, they were capable of
                      combining both high art and popular culture. Pop art in modern graphic design is represented by a work
                      created by a designer who was heavily influenced by the movement.</p>
                        <br>The term “pop art” refers to an art movement that advocated and chastised the commercial arts. Pop art
                    has been incorporated into the design and advertising of graphic art and advertising in recent years.</br>
                        <p>Pop art is heavily influenced by graphic design because it relies heavily on the use of recognizable
                      shapes, colors, and typography. Pop art also utilizes a variety of visual elements, including photography,
                      text, and illustration, to create an artistic epresentation of popular culture. Graphic design is used to
                      bridge the gap between the physical and the digital, enabling artists to create visual messages that are
                      more engaging and memorable. Graphic design allows the artist to craft a message that is more easily
                      identifiable and can be used to communicate a message in a more interesting manner. By utilizing the
                      principles of graphic design, pop art can express a message more clearly, making it more impactful and
                      memorable.</p>
